      <li>
        Avoid inline and internal css declarations. Rather use an external css
        files to improve legibility and scalability.
      </li>
      <li>
        The property "text-align: center" centers horizontally an inline element
        in relation to its parent element.
      </li>
      <li>The default font-size is 16px.</li>
      <li>
        The line hight specifies the ratio between font size and vertical line
        spacing. E.g, a 1.5 line heigt means that each line has 150% the height
        of the specified font size.
      </li>
      <li>
        With list selectors it is possible to style several elements at the same
        time. E.g., h1, h2, h3 { .... } these three elements are styled at the
        same time.
      </li>
      <li>
        With descendant selectors, we style all the specified child elements of
        the hierarchy. E.g., "footer p { ... }" styles all paragraphs that are
        children of the page footer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use classes instead of ids, so the class can easily be applied to
        another element during the project progress.
      </li>
