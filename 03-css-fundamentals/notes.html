    <h1>Section 3 notes</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Avoid inline and internal css declarations. Rather use an external css
        files to improve legibility and scalability.
      </li>
      <li>
        The property "text-align: center" centers horizontally an inline element
        in relation to its parent element.
      </li>
      <li>The default font-size is 16px.</li>
      <li>
        The line hight specifies the ratio between font size and vertical line
        spacing. E.g, a 1.5 line heigt means that each line has 150% the height
        of the specified font size.
      </li>
      <li>
        List selectors allow styling several elements at the same time. For
        example: h1, h2, h3 { .... } style all these headers simultaneously.
      </li>
      <li>
        Descendant selectors allow styling only elements of the specified
        hierarchy. Example: footer p { ... } styles all paragraphs that are
        children of the page footer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use classes instead of ids, so the class can easily be applied to
        another element during the project progress.
      </li>
      <li>
        When two margins "touch", they "collapse". I.e., the occupied area only
        show the larger margin, and the shorter is ignored.
      </li>
      <li>
        When setting dimensions using percentages, the percentage represents the
        amount of space of the parent container.
      </li>
      <li>
        When using percentages on dimensions, the element becomes responsive.
        I.e., it adapts to any screen size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Inline elements only occupy the space it needs, height and width-based
        attributes don't apply (height, width, vertcal margins, vertical
        paddings, etc.).
      </li>
      <li>
        It is possible to chain two or more pseudo-classes. Example:
        a:link:last-child
      </li>
    </ul>
